# {PROJECT_NAME} - Spec-Kit Development Environment

## Overview

This project uses the **Spec-Kit methodology** - an enhanced version of Spec-Driven Development that integrates comprehensive project discovery, structured methodology application, expert systems, and multi-agent coordination.

## Architecture & Integration

The Spec-Kit creates a multi-layered development system:

- **Layer 1**: Project Foundation (Discovery & Planning)
- **Layer 2**: Structured Methodology (SPARC)
- **Layer 3**: Expert Knowledge Systems
- **Layer 4**: Collaborative Framework (PACT)

## Available Commands

### Core SDD Commands (Always Available)

- **`/specify`** - Start new feature by creating specification and feature branch
- **`/plan`** - Plan feature implementation with technical details and architecture  
- **`/tasks`** - Break down plan into executable, numbered tasks with dependencies

### Foundation Commands (Step 1 Integration)

- **`/discover`** - Execute comprehensive project discovery with market reality checks
- **`/enhance`** - Upgrade existing projects with enhanced analysis and codebase extraction

### Methodology Commands (Step 2 Integration)

- **`/sparc`** - Apply SPARC methodology (Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, Completion)

### Expert System Commands (Step 3 Integration)

- **`/expert`** - Generate or consult specialized expert context files with agentic integration

### Collaboration Commands (Step 4 Integration)

- **`/pact`** - Implement PACT framework (Planning, Action, Coordination, Testing) for multi-agent coordination

### Orchestration Commands (Cross-Layer Integration)

- **`/workflow`** - Execute integrated workflow combining multiple methodologies
- **`/sync`** - Update and synchronize expert and memory systems for consistency

## Integration Patterns

### New Project Development

```bash
/discover "Project overview" → /sparc → /expert → /pact → /specify → /plan → /tasks
```

### Feature Development (Enhanced SDD)

```bash
/specify "Feature description" → /plan "Implementation" → /tasks "Break down work"
```

### Complex Feature Development

```bash
/sparc --phase=specification → /specify → /plan → /tasks
```

### Brownfield Enhancement

```bash
/enhance "Existing project analysis" → /sparc --selective → /specify → /plan → /tasks
```

### Full Integration Workflow

```bash
/workflow --type=feature-development "Feature description"
```

## Quality Gates

- **Step 1**: Project viability and market reality validation
- **Step 2**: SPARC phase completion and validation criteria  
- **Step 3**: Expert review and domain-specific validation
- **Step 4**: Collaborative quality assurance and coordination validation

## Synchronization

Use `/sync` regularly to maintain consistency across:

- Expert knowledge systems
- Memory and constitutional principles
- Cross-system documentation alignment
- Agent coordination mechanisms
