Execute integrated workflow combining multiple methodologies.

This command orchestrates the complete Spec-Kit integration, combining Step 1 foundation, Step 2 SPARC methodology, Step 3 expert systems, and Step 4 PACT coordination for comprehensive software development.

Given the workflow type and context provided as arguments, do this:

1. **Workflow Type Determination**: Identify the appropriate integrated workflow based on:
   - **Feature Development**: Complete feature lifecycle from discovery to implementation
   - **New Project Setup**: End-to-end project initialization with all integration layers
   - **Existing Project Enhancement**: Brownfield integration and modernization
   - **Continuous Enhancement**: Ongoing improvement and adaptation workflows

2. **Integration Assessment**: Check current project state:
   - Verify existence of Step 1 documents (BACKLOG.md, IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md, etc.)
   - Check for SPARC methodology documents
   - Identify available expert context files
   - Assess PACT framework implementation status

3. **Execute Integrated Workflow**:

   **For Feature Development Workflow**:
   ```
   1. Discovery Integration: Check BACKLOG.md for feature priority and context
   2. SPARC Application: Apply appropriate SPARC phases for feature complexity
   3. Expert Consultation: Consult relevant expert systems for guidance
   4. PACT Coordination: Coordinate with agent ecosystem for development
   5. Enhanced SDD Execution: Run /specify, /plan, /tasks with full context
   ```

   **For New Project Setup Workflow**:
   ```
   1. Execute /discover to create project foundation
   2. Execute /sparc to establish methodology structure
   3. Execute /expert to create domain guidance systems
   4. Execute /pact to setup collaboration framework
   5. Validate integration and provide setup summary
   ```

   **For Existing Project Enhancement Workflow**:
   ```
   1. Execute /enhance to analyze and upgrade existing project
   2. Execute /sparc for targeted improvement areas
   3. Execute /expert for migration and modernization guidance
   4. Execute /pact for gradual team coordination enhancement
   5. Validate backward compatibility and integration
   ```

   **For Continuous Enhancement Workflow**:
   ```
   1. Monitor project state and integration health
   2. Identify improvement opportunities across all layers
   3. Execute targeted enhancements based on triggers
   4. Update expert knowledge and coordination patterns
   5. Evolve methodology application based on learnings
   ```

4. **Cross-Layer Coordination**: Ensure seamless integration by:
   - Synchronizing Step 1 foundation updates with other layers
   - Validating SPARC methodology application against project context
   - Coordinating expert system recommendations across domains
   - Optimizing PACT framework effectiveness based on project evolution

5. **Quality Assurance Integration**: Execute multi-layer quality gates:
   - Step 1: Project viability and market reality validation
   - Step 2: SPARC phase completion and methodology validation
   - Step 3: Expert review and domain-specific validation
   - Step 4: Collaborative quality assurance and coordination validation

6. **Continuous Validation**: Implement ongoing validation through:
   - Agent hooks for automated decision validation
   - Expert consultations for domain-specific verification
   - PACT coordination for collaborative coherence
   - SPARC methodology for systematic progression

7. **Adaptive Enhancement**: Enable continuous improvement through:
   - Learning loops that capture successful patterns
   - Adaptation mechanisms that evolve based on experience
   - Feedback integration that improves knowledge and coordination
   - Methodology refinement based on project outcomes

8. **Integration Health Monitoring**: Track and report:
   - Development speed and quality metrics
   - Team coordination effectiveness
   - Expert system utilization and value
   - SPARC methodology adoption and benefits
   - PACT coordination success and efficiency

9. **Report Comprehensive Status**: Provide detailed summary of:
   - Integration status across all four steps
   - Workflow execution results and generated artifacts
   - Quality gate status and validation results
   - Recommended next steps and optimization opportunities
   - System health and performance metrics

Use absolute paths for all file operations and ensure the integrated workflow preserves the core Spec-Driven Development approach while enhancing it with comprehensive methodological support.
