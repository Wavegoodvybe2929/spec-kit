Update and synchronize expert and memory systems.

This command ensures all expert context files, memory systems, and project documentation remain synchronized and have proper context as the project evolves.

Given the synchronization scope and context provided as arguments, do this:

1. **Project State Analysis**: Assess current project state and identify synchronization needs:
   - Analyze changes since last synchronization
   - Identify outdated or inconsistent documentation
   - Detect new requirements or architectural decisions
   - Review expert system usage patterns and effectiveness

2. **Memory System Update**: Update constitutional and foundational memory:
   - **Review `memory/constitution.md`**: Ensure constitutional principles align with current project needs
   - **Update `memory/constitution_update_checklist.md`**: Track changes and validation requirements
   - **Validate Project Consistency**: Check that all documents follow current constitutional guidelines
   - **Archive Outdated Decisions**: Move superseded decisions to historical context

3. **Expert System Synchronization**: Update all expert context files to reflect current project state:

   **Core Expert Updates**:
   - **Project Type Expert**: Update with new domain insights and project evolution
   - **Architecture Expert**: Sync with latest architectural decisions and patterns
   - **Tech Stack Expert**: Update with new libraries, frameworks, and technology choices
   - **Methodology Expert**: Align with current development process optimizations

   **Specialized Expert Updates**:
   - **Performance Expert**: Update with current performance requirements and bottlenecks
   - **Security Expert**: Sync with latest security requirements and compliance needs
   - **Database Expert**: Update with schema changes and data architecture evolution
   - **API Expert**: Sync with API changes and integration requirements

   **Process Expert Updates**:
   - **Orchestrator Expert**: Update task routing based on current project complexity
   - **Debug Expert**: Sync with common issues and resolution patterns discovered
   - **Documentation Expert**: Update standards based on current documentation needs
   - **Quality Validation Expert**: Align with current quality metrics and standards

   **Agentic Framework Expert Updates**:
   - **Agent Coordination Expert**: Update coordination patterns based on effectiveness
   - **Collaborative Intelligence Expert**: Sync with team collaboration insights
   - **Adaptive Learning Expert**: Update learning mechanisms based on project experience
   - **Emergent Architecture Expert**: Align with architectural evolution patterns

4. **Cross-Reference Validation**: Ensure consistency across all documentation:
   - **Step 1-4 Integration**: Verify all steps reference consistent information
   - **Command Template Alignment**: Ensure command templates reflect current project state
   - **Expert Cross-References**: Validate that expert files reference each other correctly
   - **Methodology Integration**: Check SPARC-PACT-SDD integration remains coherent

5. **Context Propagation**: Update context throughout the system:
   - **Update `.copilot-instructions.md`**: Reflect current project state and new expert capabilities
   - **Sync Agent Hooks**: Update automation based on new patterns and requirements
   - **Refresh PACT Documents**: Align collaboration frameworks with current team dynamics
   - **Update SPARC Integration**: Ensure methodology integration reflects latest practices

6. **Dependency and Integration Updates**:
   - **BACKLOG.md Sync**: Ensure backlog reflects current priorities and completed work
   - **IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md Refresh**: Update with latest technical decisions and constraints
   - **RISK_ASSESSMENT.md Review**: Add new risks, remove mitigated risks, update mitigation strategies
   - **FILE_OUTLINE.md Update**: Reflect current project structure and organization

7. **Quality Assurance Sync**:
   - **Validation Criteria Update**: Refresh quality gates based on project experience
   - **Testing Framework Sync**: Update testing approaches based on current needs
   - **Performance Metrics Refresh**: Align metrics with current performance requirements
   - **Security Standards Update**: Sync with latest security practices and compliance needs

8. **Learning Integration**: Capture and integrate lessons learned:
   - **Pattern Recognition**: Identify successful patterns for future use
   - **Anti-Pattern Documentation**: Document what doesn't work to avoid repetition
   - **Best Practice Evolution**: Update best practices based on project experience
   - **Decision Rationale Capture**: Document why decisions were made for future reference

9. **Synchronization Verification**: Validate that synchronization is complete and effective:
   - **Consistency Checks**: Verify all documents reference consistent information
   - **Integration Testing**: Ensure updated systems work together effectively
   - **Expert System Validation**: Test that expert consultations provide current, relevant guidance
   - **Workflow Verification**: Confirm that updated systems enhance rather than hinder workflows

10. **User Consultation for Synchronization**: Ask targeted questions about:
    - What changes have occurred since last synchronization?
    - Are there new requirements, constraints, or priorities?
    - What expert guidance has been most/least helpful?
    - Are there new coordination challenges or team dynamics?
    - What quality issues or technical debt has accumulated?
    - Are there new technologies or methodologies to integrate?

11. **Synchronization Reporting**: Provide comprehensive update summary:
    - **Updated Documents**: List all files updated and nature of changes
    - **Consistency Fixes**: Document inconsistencies resolved
    - **New Context Added**: Highlight new information integrated
    - **Deprecated Content**: Note outdated information removed
    - **Integration Improvements**: Describe enhanced cross-system coordination
    - **Recommendations**: Suggest follow-up actions or future synchronization triggers

12. **Automated Sync Triggers**: Establish triggers for future synchronization:
    - **Change Detection**: Monitor for significant project changes
    - **Time-Based Sync**: Schedule regular synchronization intervals
    - **Milestone Triggers**: Sync at project milestones or phase completions
    - **Quality Threshold Triggers**: Sync when quality metrics indicate inconsistency

Store all updates using absolute paths and ensure synchronization maintains backward compatibility while improving system coherence and effectiveness.
