# Implement PACT Framework

Implement PACT framework for multi-agent coordination.

This command establishes the PACT (Planning, Action, Coordination, Testing) framework for effective multi-agent collaboration in software development projects.

## Purpose

PACT addresses the unique challenges of agentic development:

- **Planning (P)**: Establishing agent roles, task distribution, and coordination protocols
- **Action (A)**: Executing tasks while maintaining real-time agent coordination  
- **Coordination (C)**: Optimizing collaboration and ensuring system coherence
- **Testing (T)**: Validating both individual contributions and collaborative behaviors

## Integration with Existing Frameworks

### PACT + SPARC Integration

PACT can be integrated with the existing SPARC methodology in three ways:

1. **PACT as Meta-Framework**: Apply PACT phases to coordinate how agents work together throughout the entire SPARC process
2. **PACT within SPARC Phases**: Apply PACT principles within individual SPARC phases  
3. **Hybrid PACT-SPARC Methodology**: Create a unified methodology combining both frameworks

Given the coordination requirements and context provided as arguments, do this:

1. **Project Assessment**: Analyze coordination requirements based on:
   - Project complexity and scope from existing documentation
   - Number and types of agents involved in development
   - Integration needs with existing SPARC methodology
   - Team collaboration patterns and constraints

2. **User Consultation**: Ask the user about:
   - How many agents will be involved in the project?
   - What are the primary roles and capabilities of each agent?
   - What level of autonomy should each agent have?
   - Are there any constraints on agent interactions or capabilities?
   - What types of coordination challenges do you anticipate?
   - How complex are the interdependencies between tasks?
   - What shared resources will agents need to coordinate access to?
   - How should conflicts or disagreements between agents be resolved?
   - How should PACT integrate with existing SPARC methodology?
   - Are there existing development processes that need to be considered?
   - How will you measure the effectiveness of agent coordination?
   - What quality and validation requirements exist?
   - How should the framework adapt as the project evolves?

3. **Generate Core PACT Documents**:

   **AGENT_ECOSYSTEM_DESIGN.md**:
   - **Agent Role Definitions**: Specific capabilities and responsibilities for each agent type
   - **Agent Interaction Patterns**: Communication protocols and workflow integration

6. **PACT-SDD Integration**: Ensure PACT framework enhances rather than replaces existing `/specify`, `/plan`, `/tasks` workflow by:
   - **Coordinated Specification**: Multi-agent collaboration in specification creation
   - **Collaborative Planning**: Enhanced planning through collective intelligence
   - **Optimized Task Distribution**: Parallel execution and intelligent task assignment
   - **Multi-Agent Validation**: Quality assurance through collaborative review

7. **Integration Modes**:
   
   **For New Projects**:
   - Full PACT implementation from project start
   - Integration with Step 1-3 outputs for comprehensive coordination
   - Establishment of agent roles based on project requirements

   **For Existing Projects (Brownfield)**:
   - **Gradual PACT Adoption**: Incremental introduction of coordination mechanisms
   - **Legacy Integration**: Preservation and enhancement of existing workflows
   - **Team Process Integration**: Alignment with current development practices
   - **Workflow Enhancement**: Adding coordination benefits while maintaining familiarity

8. **Validation and Testing Setup**:
   - **Success Metrics**: Define effectiveness measures for agent coordination
   - **Feedback Mechanisms**: Create continuous improvement and learning systems
   - **Behavioral Monitoring**: Track and analyze collaborative behavior quality
   - **Optimization Systems**: Learning mechanisms for coordination improvement

9. **Best Practices for Implementation**:
   - **Start Simple**: Begin with minimal viable agent ecosystem and expand as needed
   - **Design for Autonomy**: Preserve individual agent decision-making capabilities
   - **Enable Collaboration**: Create clear mechanisms for effective agent coordination
   - **Validate Continuously**: Implement ongoing validation of individual and collaborative work
   - **Adapt Dynamically**: Allow framework evolution based on project needs and learnings
   - **Document Everything**: Maintain comprehensive coordination decisions and outcomes
   - **Learn and Improve**: Capture learnings and refine coordination strategies over time

10. **Expected Outcomes**: After implementing PACT framework documentation, you should have:
    - Clear understanding of agent roles and responsibilities
    - Effective coordination mechanisms for multi-agent development
    - Integration strategies combining PACT with SPARC methodology
    - Comprehensive validation approaches for agentic systems
    - Adaptive frameworks that evolve with project needs
    - Quality assurance mechanisms for collaborative development
    - Documentation supporting ongoing agent coordination and improvement

11. **Report Completion**: Provide summary of:
    - Generated PACT framework documents and their purposes
    - Integration status with existing methodologies (SPARC, SDD)
    - Agent ecosystem design and coordination protocols
    - Recommended implementation approach and next steps
    - Success metrics and validation framework setup

**Getting Started Guidelines**:

1. Read the `pact_framework_guide.md` for comprehensive understanding
2. Use the document templates provided in the methodology
3. Start with Agent Ecosystem Design to establish foundations
4. Progress through each PACT phase systematically  
5. Integrate with existing SPARC processes as appropriate
6. Validate and refine framework based on project experience

Remember: PACT enhances agent collaboration while preserving individual agent autonomy. Focus on coordination mechanisms that enable effective collaboration without constraining agent decision-making capabilities.

Store PACT documents in project root using absolute paths and ensure seamless integration with existing Step 1-3 outputs and original Spec-Driven Development workflow.
